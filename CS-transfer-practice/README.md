# Major Changing Practice

**These C files were written in my first year at NCUT when I was preparing to switch my major. As a beginner, it's hard for me to solve these problems on my own at first. So, I exerted myself to learn plenty of necessary knowledge and solve a lot of problems(100+ in 2 months), and eventually I really did it!!!**

**So no matter what, it's possible for us all to achieve our goal, whether you wanna switch your major or become a coder. Don't hesitate, act now! ! !**
